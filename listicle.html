  		<b><span class="pnumber">1.</span>Italian soda at Bytes</b>
          <ul>

          When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but Iwanted to join my friend
  			for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and Ibecame reaquainted with the combination of fizzy water and
  			articial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored
  			carbonated water. The Italian sodas at bytes also have cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask; I
  			haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you're feeling a refreshing
  			drink that doesn't have caffeineor milk.
  				<p><b>Recommendation:</b> Raspberry Italian soda</p>

  		<b><span class="pnumber">2.</span>Bubble tea at Pop Tea Bar</b>
          <ul>
              <li type="none"><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3jHRC2umZCy"> 456 Cambridge Ave, Palo Alto, CA</a></li>
          </ul>

          When your boba craving strikes, head over to Pop Tea Bar, a cute little bubble tea shop on Cambridge
      Avenue. The menu is your standard buble tea fare with nothing too adventurous on the menu -- on
      bubble tea floats, for wxample -- but the tapioca is fresh, the service is fast, and the tea is smooth and
      delicious! They have little bites to eat too, like popcorn chicken and eggrolls, in perfect snack-size portions.
      There's not too much seating, but there's a cute outdoor area in the back for warmer days.
      <p>Pop Tea Bar isn't exactly on camous, but the Marguerite has got you covered. Ride the 1050A to California
      and El Camino and it's a short walk from there. (11 minutes total from the Gates Computer Science
      Building!)
      </p>
  				<p><b>Recommendation:</b> Classic Milk Tea with tapioca + an order of popcorn chicken.</p>

  		<b><span class="pnumber">3.</span>Latte at CoHo</b>
          <ul>

  			<div class="texts">
          I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only because CoHo is the only
  			place I've ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not even totally sure I know what a Vanilla Bean Latte
  			is supposed to taste like. What I do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on a whim from CoHo was delicious.
  				<p><b>Recommendation:</b> Vanilla Bean Latte</p>

  		<b><span class="pnumber">4.</span>Agua Fresca at Nexus Cafe</b>

          Nexus Cafe has a lot tasty things packed into its cafeteria space, including agua fresca! Grab a cup of this
  			fresh and fruity beverage before you head to the check out line. Nexus Cafe has plenty of indoor and
  			outdoor seating, too, so on the next sunny day, take a break on the patio with a cup of agua fresca, and maybe a burrito.
  				<p><b>Recommendation:</b> Agua Fresca</p>
